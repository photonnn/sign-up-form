Purpose of this text file is to journal my decisions partaking in this project.

1. Foundations:

The web page will follow a design, that is include in the assets folder.

Following the design, I will create 2 divs  and use flexbox to divide the 
screen in two areas. I will tackle left side first as it seems simpler.

2. Setting image as background: 

The background of the left side is an image, therefore I will make its width
the same as the width of the image.
Image is way to big so I decided to just use background-size to fit it in the
container. I will for, now let right side grow more.

3) Logo and text above image:

The first div will contain the logo and name and it will be placed on top of the
image. To do this, I will set image div as postion relative and logo div as 
position absolute. I'll use vh and then make a seperate media query for the 
mobile.

Just noticed that it is not necessary to make image to position realtive, as it
part of the background, therefore absolute can be replaced by relative for the 
text on top. Also just noticed, that if you put dev tools on the bottom, the 
height of the text does not scale properly, have to fix that.
