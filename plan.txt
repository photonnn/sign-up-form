Purpose of this text file is to journal my decisions partaking in this project.

1)

The web page will follow a design, that is include in the assets folder.

Following the design, I will create 2 divs  and use flexbox to divide the 
screen in two areas. I will tackle left side first as it seems simpler.

2) 

The background of the left side is an image, therefore I will make its width
the same as the width of the image.
Image is way to big so I decided to just use background-size to fit it in the
container. I will for, now let right side grow more.
