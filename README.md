# sign-up-form

Sign-up page, mostly just html & css, but I have included an event listener
to check whether the passwords are the same. Other than that I have tried to
make it as responsive as I could.
I have added a media query for mobile and flexed some of the things I have 
learned the past few days, such as css variables and forms etc.
